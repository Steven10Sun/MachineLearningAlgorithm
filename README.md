This is a my owned machine learning model.
The machine learning models will include 
* Linear Regression
* logistics Regression
* KNN
* K-Mean
* Decision Tree

More models will be continuously updated and added. 

All the models will be followed the template below.
each ML models have the following 3 main components. 
1. Prediction model: formular to do the prediction.
2. Cost/Loss function: the technique of evaluating "the performance of the algorithm/model"
3. Optimization algorithm: a procedure which is executed iteratively to find the optimum and minimize the cost function.
